# notes 12-21

## zeroing out

most compileers zero out things that are initialized
fun fact, you can test this in by cout ... or even better, by the Visual Studio debugger

## reversing the array

you got it, awesome!
working backwards in a for loop :)

## function

write a function that takes in:

1. an array of chars
2. the size of the array
3. an index (int)

...and does what you just did: shift 'x' into the array at that index

> tip: `void` is the "don't return anything" return type

## pointers

an array value is actually "just" a pointer to a place in memory.
a pointer is the value of some memory space on your computer

it's an index in the giant array of your computer's memory

> passing char* is passing a pointer, and is passing an array - those are the same!
