# Second Meeting

...but really our first "regular" meeting!
To start a standard, I've put miscellaneous / housekeeping notes here, and created separate `.md` files for individual topics.

## Discussion Preferences

Between Discord, Email, Slack, etc. - we're going to go with Discord links to a GitHub repo's pages.
That's this repo!

I'll DM with links to homework and meeting folders as I put them up.

## Markdown

I'm putting notes in `.md` files that adhere to the **Markdown** format.
It's a text format that lets you apply basic text formatting with characters such as `_` and `*`.

> Fun fact: both Discord and Slack use versions of it in their messages.

For example, to add a code block, use three backticks (<code>```</code>) and then the language name.

Given this:

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>

    int main()

{
std::cout << "Hello, world!\n";
}
```

...you get:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, world!\n";
}
```

## Regular Meetings

Raymond availability: Tues, Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sun afternoons.
(mon wed in class)

For now: **Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6pm PST / 9pm EST**.

## Future Project Ideation

You're hoping for one that would help make you appealing to medical device companies.
Your idea is a heart monitor & bluetooth combo that sends info from a microcontroller device to a phone application.
That phone app would chart heart monitor data.
The microcontroller part could work with C instead of verilog.

### Good Idea?

**Yes**.
Companies love people who can demonstrate having worked on projects in their technical area, _especially_ if they're also in their product area.
This seems like a great way to showcase passion, general tech chops, and specific tech area chops.

### Mobile Language?

Oh, there are a lot of pros and cons...
My recommendation is to not tackle mobile development for a while, as you're still learning core C/C++ development.
You might eventually choose to write a desktop app closer to your existing expertise instead.

For cross-platform development, you might use a framework like **React Native** (**JavaScript** or **TypeScript**).

Android development can be done in **C++** (though it's not super friendly), **Java** (old & less liked), or **Kotlin** (newer & more liked).

iOS development can be done in **C++** (though it's not super friendly), **Objective C** (old & less liked), or **Swift** (newer & more liked).
