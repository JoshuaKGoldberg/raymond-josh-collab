# Debuggers

A \*_debugger_ is tool that stops and stops your program, letting you inspect values in-between.
Pressing <kbd>F5</kbd> in Visual Studio starts the program in debugger mode by default.

## Breakpoints

Click the dimmed space to the left of a line number in Visual Studio to toggle a big red circle there indicating a **breakpoint**.
A breakpoint is ytou telling an IDE to halt on a line of code when debugging it.

## Inspecting Variables

While a program is paused (a breakpoint is hit), your IDE will show you values for each variable.
This is really useful for debugging!

Note that a variable will have an unknown, gibberish value until you step to a line of code after it's set a value.
